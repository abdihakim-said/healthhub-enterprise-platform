# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Repository Structure for Maximum Impact

Your HealthHub project repository should be structured to showcase both technical depth and visual appeal. Here's the recommended setup:

```
healthhub-multi-cloud-platform/
├── README.md                          # Main project showcase
├── architecture/                      # Visual architecture diagrams

```

## Visual Showcase Strategy

### 1. Lead with Architecture
Your README should immediately showcase the comprehensive solution architecture:

```markdown

```

### 2. Feature Demonstrations
Include live application screenshots to show real functionality:

- **Virtual Assistant**: Shows OpenAI GPT-4 integration in action
- **Medical Transcription**: Demonstrates Azure Speech Services accuracy
- **Image Analysis**: Highlights Google Cloud Vision capabilities

### 3. Multi-Cloud Integration
Use service-specific diagrams to explain technical decisions:

- OpenAI Assistant API integration
- Azure Speech Services processing
- Google Cloud Vision analysis
